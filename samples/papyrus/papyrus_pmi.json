At the same time, Papyrus project is switching to a tycho/maven based build. The main goal here is to rely on the <a href=\"https://www.eclipse.org/community/eclipse_newsletter/2013/august/article3.php\">Common Build Infrastructure</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/q/project:papyrus/org.eclipse.papyrus+-status:draft,n,z\">Gerrit</a> is used for almost all external contributions. The contributions are currently build on the HIPP for Papyrus. We are currently working on running also the test jobs against these contributions.</p>\n<p>The complete documentation is published for each release <a href=\"https://www.eclipse.org/papyrus/project-info/new_and_noteworthy_0.10.0.php\">on the Papyrus website</a>. It includes the detailed <a href=\"http://www.eclipse.org/sirius/doc/Release%20Notes.html\">release notes</a> for all changes between releases. </p>\n"
