<h4 id="NonCaseLabelInSwitchStatement">Non Case Label In Switch Statement (NonCaseLabelInSwitchStatement)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: ANA</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: 3</p>
<p class="desc">From: PMD Design Rules 5.1.2</p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="subdesc">A non-case label (e.g. a named break/continue label) was present in a switch statement. This is legal, but confusing. It is easy to mix up the case labels and the non-case labels.</p>
<p class="subdesc">This rule impacts analysability, since this may confuse the maintainer when reading the switch. By the way, introducing a label <i>in</i> the switch creates an intricate control flow and is discouraged.</p>
<h4 id="AvoidDecimalLiteralsInBigDecimalConstructor">Avoid Decimal Literals In BigDecimal Constructor (AvoidDecimalLiteralsInBigDecimalConstructor)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: REL CHA</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">From: PMD Basic Rules 5.1.2</p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="subdesc">One might assume that the result of 'new BigDecimal(0.1)' is exactly equal to 0.1, but it is actually equal to .1000000000000000055511151231257827021181583404541015625. This is because 0.1 cannot be represented exactly as a double (or as a binary fraction of any finite length). Thus, the long value that is being passed in to the constructor is not exactly equal to 0.1, appearances notwithstanding. The (String) constructor, on the other hand, is perfectly predictable: 'new BigDecimal('0.1')' is exactly equal to 0.1, as one would expect. Therefore, it is generally recommended that the (String) constructor be used in preference to this one.</p>
<p class="subdesc">This rule impacts product reliability, since the actual number is not the one intended and precision errors may arise.</p>
<h4 id="EmptyIfStmt">Empty If Stmt (EmptyIfStmt)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: ANA EFF</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: 3</p>
<p class="desc">From: PMD Empty Rules 5.1.2</p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="subdesc">Empty If Statement finds instances where a condition is checked but nothing is done about it.</p>
<p class="subdesc">This rule impacts analysability, since it introduces unnecessary code. It also impacts resources, since it takes unnecessary space and cpu.</p>
<h4 id="AbstractClassWithoutAnyMethod">Abstract Class Without Any Method (AbstractClassWithoutAnyMethod)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: CHA</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: 3</p>
<p class="desc">From: PMD Design Rules 5.1.2</p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="subdesc">If an abstract class does not provides any methods, it may be acting as a simple data container that is not meant to be instantiated. In this case, it is probably better to use a private or protected constructor in order to prevent instantiation than make the class misleadingly abstract.</p>
<p class="subdesc">This rule impacts changeability, since the intent of the class is made much clearer for the maintainer.</p>
<h4 id="MisplacedNullCheck">Misplaced Null Check (MisplacedNullCheck)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: REL ANA</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">From: PMD Basic Rules 5.1.2</p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="subdesc">The null check here is misplaced. If the variable is null a NullPointerException will be thrown. Either the check is useless (the variable will never be 'null') or it is incorrect.</p>
<p class="subdesc">This pattern impacts the reliability, since an exception may be thrown. It also impacts analysability, since the maintainer will take unnecessary time to understand that the null is misplaced.</p>
<h4 id="EC_NULL_ARG">EC: Call to equals(null) (EC_NULL_ARG)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: COR ANA</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: 3</p>
<p class="desc">From: FindBugs Rules 3.0.0</p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="subdesc">This method calls equals(Object), passing a null value as the argument. According to the contract of the equals() method, this call should always return <code>false</code>.</p>
<p class="subdesc">This rule impacts correctness, since the result is not what was intended. It also impacts analysability, since it is useless and unnecessary code.</p>
<h4 id="DoubleCheckedLocking">Double Checked Locking (DoubleCheckedLocking)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: REL</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">From: PMD Basic Rules 5.1.2</p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="subdesc">Partially created objects can be returned by the Double Checked Locking pattern when used in Java. An optimizing JRE may assign a reference to the baz variable before it creates the object the reference is intended to point to. For more details refer to: http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-02-2001/jw-0209-double.html</p>
<p class="subdesc">The double check pattern impacts reliability, since the code may produce a crash or unpredictable behaviour when the half-defined class is used.</p>
<h4 id="SE_BAD_FIELD_INNER_CLASS">Se: Non-serializable class has a serializable inner class  (SE_BAD_FIELD_INNER_CLASS)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: REL</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: 2</p>
<p class="desc">From: FindBugs Rules 3.0.0</p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="subdesc">This Serializable class is an inner class of a non-serializable class. Thus, attempts to serialize it will also attempt to associate instance of the outer class with which it is associated, leading to a runtime error. If possible, making the inner class a static inner class should solve the problem. Making the outer class serializable might also work, but that would mean serializing an instance of the inner class would always also serialize the instance of the outer class, which it often not what you really want. </p>
<p class="subdesc">This rule impacts reliability, since an exception will occur when attempting to serialise the inner class.</p>
<h4 id="DP_DO_INSIDE_DO_PRIVILEGED">DP: Method invoked that should be only be invoked inside a doPrivileged block  (DP_DO_INSIDE_DO_PRIVILEGED)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: SEC</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: 4</p>
<p class="desc">From: FindBugs Rules 3.0.0</p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="subdesc">This code invokes a method that requires a security permission check. If this code will be granted security permissions, but might be invoked by code that does not have security permissions, then the invocation needs to occur inside a doPrivileged block.</p>
<h4 id="AvoidUsingOctalValues">Avoid Using Octal Values (AvoidUsingOctalValues)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: REL ANA</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: 3</p>
<p class="desc">From: PMD Basic Rules 5.1.2</p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="subdesc">Integer literals should not start with zero since this denotes that the rest of literal will be interpreted as an octal value.</p>
<p class="subdesc">This rule impacts reliability, since the number specified may not be the one intended. It also impacts analysability, since the maintainer will have trouble deciding if the value is a decimal or octal value.</p>
<h4 id="ReturnEmptyArrayRatherThanNull">Return Empty Array Rather Than Null (ReturnEmptyArrayRatherThanNull)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: REL</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: 3</p>
<p class="desc">From: PMD Design Rules 5.1.2</p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="subdesc">For any method that returns an array, it is a better to return an empty array rather than a null reference. This removes the need for null checking all results and avoids inadvertent NullPointerExceptions. </p>
<p class="subdesc">This rule impacts reliability, since a NullPointerException may arise from the method's caller.</p>
<h4 id="DMI_EMPTY_DB_PASSWORD">Dm: Empty database password  (DMI_EMPTY_DB_PASSWORD)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: SEC</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: 2</p>
<p class="desc">From: FindBugs Rules 3.0.0</p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="subdesc">This code creates a database connect using a blank or empty password. This indicates that the database is not protected by a password. </p>
<h4 id="EQ_OTHER_NO_OBJECT">Eq: equals() method defined that doesn't override equals(Object) (EQ_OTHER_NO_OBJECT)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: COR REU</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: 3</p>
<p class="desc">From: FindBugs Rules 3.0.0</p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="subdesc">This class defines an <code>equals()</code> method, that doesn't override the normal <code>equals(Object)</code> method defined in the base <code>java.lang.Object</code> class. Instead, it inherits an <code>equals(Object)</code> method from a superclass. The class should probably define a <code>boolean equals(Object)</code> method. </p>
<p class="subdesc">This rule impacts correctness, since the result is not what was intended. It also impacts reusability, since other developers will be confused by this method's name.</p>
<h4 id="EI_EXPOSE_REP">EI: May expose internal representation by returning reference to mutable object  (EI_EXPOSE_REP)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: SEC</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: 3</p>
<p class="desc">From: FindBugs Rules 3.0.0</p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="subdesc">Returning a reference to a mutable object value stored in one of the object's fields exposes the internal representation of the object. If instances are accessed by untrusted code, and unchecked changes to the mutable object would compromise security or other important properties, you will need to do something different. Returning a new copy of the object is better approach in many situations.</p>
<h4 id="DM_USELESS_THREAD">Dm: A thread was created using the default empty run method  (DM_USELESS_THREAD)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: EFF THR</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: 3</p>
<p class="desc">From: FindBugs Rules 3.0.0</p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="subdesc">This method creates a thread without specifying a run method either by deriving from the Thread class, or by passing a Runnable object. This thread, then, does nothing but waste time. </p>
<p class="subdesc">This rule impacts efficiency, since the thread cannot be executed and unncessarily uses resources.</p>
<h4 id="CheckSkipResult">Check SkipResult (CheckSkipResult)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: REL</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">From: PMD Basic Rules 5.1.2</p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="subdesc">The <code>skip()</code> method may skip a smaller number of bytes than requested. Check the returned value to find out if it was the case or not.</p>
<p class="subdesc">This rule impacts reliability, since the call may not have produced the intended result.</p>
<h4 id="BC_BAD_CAST_TO_CONCRETE_COLLECTION">BC: Questionable cast to concrete collection  (BC_BAD_CAST_TO_CONCRETE_COLLECTION)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: CHA</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: 4</p>
<p class="desc">From: FindBugs Rules 3.0.0</p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="subdesc">This code casts an abstract collection (such as a Collection, List, or Set) to a specific concrete implementation (such as an ArrayList or HashSet). This might not be correct, and it may make your code fragile, since it makes it harder to switch to other concrete implementations at a future point. Unless you have a particular reason to do so, just use the abstract collection class. </p>
<h4 id="UnnecessaryLocalBeforeReturn">Unnecessary Local Before Return (UnnecessaryLocalBeforeReturn)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: ANA EFF</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: 3</p>
<p class="desc">From: PMD Design Rules 5.1.2</p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="subdesc">Avoid the creation of unnecessary local variables.</p>
<p class="subdesc">This rule impacts analysability, since it implies unnecessary code. It also impacts resources, since an unnecessary variable is created.</p>
<h4 id="ExcessiveImports">Excessive Imports (ExcessiveImports)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: REU</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: 3</p>
<p class="desc">From: PMD Coupling Rules 5.1.2</p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="subdesc">A high number of imports can indicate a high degree of coupling within an object. This rule counts the number of unique imports and reports a violation if the count is above the user-specified threshold. The default value is set to 30.</p>
<p class="subdesc">ExcessiveImports attempts to count all unique imports a class contains. This rule will count a <code>import com.something.*;</code> as a single import.</p>
<p class="subdesc">This rule impacts reusability, since many classes need to be available for this class to work.</p>
<h4 id="DMI_BIGDECIMAL_CONSTRUCTED_FROM_DOUBLE">DMI: BigDecimal constructed from double that isn't represented precisely  (DMI_BIGDECIMAL_CONSTRUCTED_FROM_DOUBLE)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: COR</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: 3</p>
<p class="desc">From: FindBugs Rules 3.0.0</p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="subdesc">This code creates a BigDecimal from a double value that doesn't translate well to a decimal number. For example, one might assume that writing new BigDecimal(0.1) in Java creates a BigDecimal which is exactly equal to 0.1 (an unscaled value of 1, with a scale of 1), but it is actually equal to 0.1000000000000000055511151231257827021181583404541015625. You probably want to use the BigDecimal.valueOf(double d) method, which uses the String representation of the double to create the BigDecimal (e.g., BigDecimal.valueOf(0.1) gives 0.1). </p>
<p class="subdesc">This rule impacts correctness, since the result is not what was intended.</p>
<h4 id="BIT_SIGNED_CHECK_HIGH_BIT">BIT: Check for sign of bitwise operation  (BIT_SIGNED_CHECK_HIGH_BIT)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: COR</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: 3</p>
<p class="desc">From: FindBugs Rules 3.0.0</p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="subdesc">This method compares an expression such as <pre>((event.detail &amp; SWT.SELECTED) &gt; 0)</pre>. Using bit arithmetic and then comparing with the greater than operator can lead to unexpected results (of course depending on the value of SWT.SELECTED). If SWT.SELECTED is a negative number, this is a candidate for a bug. Even when SWT.SELECTED is not negative, it seems good practice to use "!= 0" instead of "&gt; 0". </p>
<p class="subdesc">This rule impacts correctness, since the result is not what was intended.</p>
<h4 id="SimplifyConditional">Simplify Conditional (SimplifyConditional)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: ANA</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: 3</p>
<p class="desc">From: PMD Design Rules 5.1.2</p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="subdesc">No need to check for null before an instanceof; the instanceof keyword returns false when given a null argument.</p>
<p class="subdesc">This rule impacts analysability, since the pattern implies unnecessary code.</p>
<h4 id="SW_SWING_METHODS_INVOKED_IN_SWING_THREAD">SW: Certain swing methods needs to be invoked in Swing thread  (SW_SWING_METHODS_INVOKED_IN_SWING_THREAD)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: COR THR</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: 3</p>
<p class="desc">From: FindBugs Rules 3.0.0</p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="subdesc">(<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090526170426/">Web archive</a><a href="http://java.sun.com/developer/JDCTechTips/2003/tt1208.html">From JDC Tech Tip</a>): The Swing methods show(), setVisible(), and pack() will create the associated peer for the frame. With the creation of the peer, the system creates the event dispatch thread. This makes things problematic because the event dispatch thread could be notifying listeners while pack and validate are still processing. This situation could result in two threads going through the Swing component-based GUI -- it's a serious flaw that could result in deadlocks or other related threading issues. A pack call causes components to be realized. As they are being realized (that is, not necessarily visible), they could trigger listener notification on the event dispatch thread.</p>
<p class="subdesc">This rule impacts correctness, since the dispatch race may introduce unexpected behaviour.</p>
<h4 id="EI_EXPOSE_STATIC_REP2">MS: May expose internal static state by storing a mutable object into a static field  (EI_EXPOSE_STATIC_REP2)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: SEC</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: 3</p>
<p class="desc">From: FindBugs Rules 3.0.0</p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="subdesc">This code stores a reference to an externally mutable object into a static field. If unchecked changes to the mutable object would compromise security or other important properties, you will need to do something different. Storing a copy of the object is better approach in many situations.</p>
<h4 id="CO_COMPARETO_RESULTS_MIN_VALUE">Co: compareTo()/compare() returns Integer.MIN_VALUE (CO_COMPARETO_RESULTS_MIN_VALUE)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: COR</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: 3</p>
<p class="desc">From: FindBugs Rules 3.0.0</p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="subdesc">In some situation, this compareTo or compare method returns the constant Integer.MIN_VALUE, which is an exceptionally bad practice. The only thing that matters about the return value of compareTo is the sign of the result. But people will sometimes negate the return value of compareTo, expecting that this will negate the sign of the result. And it will, except in the case where the value returned is Integer.MIN_VALUE. So just return -1 rather than Integer.MIN_VALUE.</p>
<p class="subdesc">This rule impacts correctness, since the result is not what was intended.</p>
<h4 id="BIT_ADD_OF_SIGNED_BYTE">BIT: Bitwise add of signed byte value  (BIT_ADD_OF_SIGNED_BYTE)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: COR</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: 3</p>
<p class="desc">From: FindBugs Rules 3.0.0</p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="subdesc">Adds a byte value and a value which is known to have the 8 lower bits clear. Values loaded from a byte array are sign extended to 32 bits before any bitwise operations are performed on the value. Thus, if <code>b[0]</code> contains the value <code>0xff</code>, and <code>x</code> is initially 0, then the code <code>((x &lt;&lt; 8) + b[0])</code>  will sign extend <code>0xff</code> to get <code>0xffffffff</code>, and thus give the value <code>0xffffffff</code> as the result.</p>
<p class="subdesc">In particular, the following code for packing a byte array into an int is badly wrong:<pre>int result = 0; for(int i = 0; i < 4; i++) result = ((result << 8) + b[i]);</pre>.</p>
<p class="subdesc">The following idiom will work instead: <pre>int result = 0; for(int i = 0; i < 4; i++) result = ((result << 8) + (b[i] & 0xff));</pre>.</p>
<p class="subdesc">This rule impacts correctness, since the result is not what was intended.</p>
<h4 id="EmptySynchronizedBlock">Empty Synchronized Block (EmptySynchronizedBlock)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: ANA</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: 3</p>
<p class="desc">From: PMD Empty Rules 5.1.2</p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="subdesc">Empty synchronized blocks serve no purpose and should be removed.</p>
<p class="subdesc">This rule impacts analysability, since it implies unnecessary code.</p>
<h4 id="EQ_SELF_USE_OBJECT">Eq: Covariant equals() method defined, Object.equals(Object) inherited (EQ_SELF_USE_OBJECT)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: COR REU</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: 3</p>
<p class="desc">From: FindBugs Rules 3.0.0</p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="subdesc">This class defines a covariant version of the <code>equals()</code> method, but inherits the normal <code>equals(Object)</code> method defined in the base <code>java.lang.Object</code> class. The class should probably define a <code>boolean equals(Object)</code> method. </p>
<p class="subdesc">This rule impacts correctness, since the result is not what was intended. It also impacts reusability, since other developers will be confused by this method's name.</p>
<h4 id="BC_IMPOSSIBLE_CAST">BC: Impossible cast  (BC_IMPOSSIBLE_CAST)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: COR REL</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: 1</p>
<p class="desc">From: FindBugs Rules 3.0.0</p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="subdesc">This cast will always throw a ClassCastException. FindBugs tracks type information from instanceof checks, and also uses more precise information about the types of values returned from methods and loaded from fields. Thus, it may have more precise information that just the declared type of a variable, and can use this to determine that a cast will always throw an exception at runtime. </p>
<p class="subdesc">This rule impacts reliability, since an exception will be thrown. It also impacts correctness, since invariably throwing an exception was probably not what was intended.</p>
<h4 id="VA_FORMAT_STRING_EXPECTED_MESSAGE_FORMAT_SUPPLIED">FS: MessageFormat supplied where printf style format expected  (VA_FORMAT_STRING_EXPECTED_MESSAGE_FORMAT_SUPPLIED)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: COR</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: 3</p>
<p class="desc">From: FindBugs Rules 3.0.0</p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="subdesc">A method is called that expects a Java printf format string and a list of arguments. However, the format string doesn't contain any format specifiers (e.g., %s) but does contain message format elements (e.g., {0}).  It is likely that the code is supplying a MessageFormat string when a printf-style format string is required. At runtime, all of the arguments will be ignored and the format string will be returned exactly as provided without any formatting. </p>
<p class="subdesc">This rule impacts correctness, since the result is not what was intended.</p>
<h4 id="XSS_REQUEST_PARAMETER_TO_SERVLET_WRITER">XSS: Servlet reflected cross site scripting vulnerability  (XSS_REQUEST_PARAMETER_TO_SERVLET_WRITER)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: SEC</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: 2</p>
<p class="desc">From: FindBugs Rules 3.0.0</p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>

<p class="subdesc">FindBugs looks only for the most blatant, obvious cases of cross site scripting. If FindBugs found <em>any</em>, you <em>almost certainly</em> have more cross site scripting vulnerabilities that FindBugs doesn't report. If you are concerned about cross site scripting, you should seriously consider using a commercial static analysis or pen-testing tool.</p>
<h4 id="DMI_SCHEDULED_THREAD_POOL_EXECUTOR_WITH_ZERO_CORE_THREADS">Dm: Creation of ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor with zero core threads  (DMI_SCHEDULED_THREAD_POOL_EXECUTOR_WITH_ZERO_CORE_THREADS)</h4>

<p class="subdesc">This rule impacts correctness, since the result is not what was intended. It also impacts changeability, since a maintainer might try to change the pool size without effect.</p>
<h4 id="TooFewBranchesForASwitchStatement">Too Few Branches For A Switch Statement (TooFewBranchesForASwitchStatement)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: ANA</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: 3</p>
<p class="desc">From: PMD Design Rules 5.1.2</p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="subdesc">Switch statements are indended to be used to support complex branching behaviour. Using a switch for only a few cases is ill-advised, since switches are not as easy to understand as if-then statements. In these cases use the if-then statement to increase code readability. Default value is 3 and above.</p>
<p class="subdesc">This rule impacts analysability, since the switch statement is more difficult to read than a simple if-then.</p>
<h4 id="FE_TEST_IF_EQUAL_TO_NOT_A_NUMBER">FE: Doomed test for equality to NaN  (FE_TEST_IF_EQUAL_TO_NOT_A_NUMBER)</h4>

<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="subdesc">This code checks to see if a floating point value is equal to the special Not A Number value (e.g., <code>if (x == Double.NaN)</code>). However, because of the special semantics of <code>NaN</code>, no value is equal to <code>Nan</code>, including <code>NaN</code>. Thus, <code>x == Double.NaN</code> always evaluates to false. To check to see if a value contained in <code>x</code> is the special Not A Number value, use <code>Double.isNaN(x)</code> (or <code>Float.isNaN(x)</code> if <code>x</code> is floating point precision). </p>

<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="subdesc">Not enough arguments are passed to satisfy a placeholder in the format string. A runtime exception will occur when this statement is executed. </p>
<p class="subdesc">This rule impacts reliability, since the pattern will throw an exception when executed.</p>
<h4 id="SingularField">Singular Field (SingularField)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: CHA</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: 3</p>
<p class="desc">From: PMD Design Rules 5.1.2</p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="subdesc">Fields whose scopes are limited to just single methods do not rely on the containing object to provide them to other methods. They may be better implemented as local variables within those methods.</p>
<p class="subdesc">This rule impacts changeability, since it is easier to modify a variable at the method level than at the class level.</p>
<h4 id="EC_UNRELATED_TYPES_USING_POINTER_EQUALITY">EC: Using pointer equality to compare different types  (EC_UNRELATED_TYPES_USING_POINTER_EQUALITY)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: COR ANA</p>

<p class="subdesc">This rule impacts correctness, since the result is not what was intended. It also impacts analysability, since it is useless and unnecessary code. </p>
<h4 id="EmptyCatchBlock">Empty Catch Block (EmptyCatchBlock)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: REL</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: 3</p>
<p class="desc">From: PMD Empty Rules 5.1.2</p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>

<p class="subdesc">The fields of this class appear to be accessed inconsistently with respect to synchronization. This bug report indicates that the bug pattern detector judged that 1. the class contains a mix of locked and unlocked accesses, 2. the class is <b>not</b> annotated as javax.annotation.concurrent.NotThreadSafe, 3. at least one locked access was performed by one of the class's own methods, and 4. the number of unsynchronized field accesses (reads and writes) was no more than one third of all accesses, with writes being weighed twice as high as reads</p>
<p class="subdesc">A typical bug matching this bug pattern is forgetting to synchronize one of the methods in a class that is intended to be thread-safe. You can select the nodes labeled "Unsynchronized access" to show the code locations where the detector believed that a field was accessed without synchronization.</p>
<p class="subdesc">Note that there are various sources of inaccuracy in this detector; for example, the detector cannot statically detect all situations in which a lock is held. Also, even when the detector is accurate in distinguishing locked vs. unlocked accesses, the code in question may still be correct.</p>

Objects of this class will not be deserialised correctly if a non-Serializable object is stored in this field.</p>
<p class="subdesc">This rule impacts correctness, since the class may be wrongly deserialised.</p>
<h4 id="VA_FORMAT_STRING_BAD_CONVERSION">FS: The type of a supplied argument doesn't match format specifier  (VA_FORMAT_STRING_BAD_CONVERSION)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: REL</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: 1</p>
<p class="desc">From: FindBugs Rules 3.0.0</p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="subdesc">One of the arguments is uncompatible with the corresponding format string specifier. As a result, this will generate a runtime exception when executed. For example, <code>String.format("%d", "1")</code> will generate an exception, since the String "1" is incompatible with the format specifier %d. </p>
<p class="subdesc">This rule impacts reliability, since the pattern will throw an exception when executed.</p>
<h4 id="DMI_ANNOTATION_IS_NOT_VISIBLE_TO_REFLECTION">Dm: Can't use reflection to check for presence of annotation without runtime retention  (DMI_ANNOTATION_IS_NOT_VISIBLE_TO_REFLECTION)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: COR</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: 4</p>
<p class="desc">From: FindBugs Rules 3.0.0</p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="subdesc">Unless an annotation has itself been annotated with  @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME), the annotation can't be observed using reflection (e.g., by using the isAnnotationPresent method).</p>
<p class="subdesc">This rule impacts correctness, since the result is not what was intended.</p>
<h4 id="BC_BAD_CAST_TO_ABSTRACT_COLLECTION">BC: Questionable cast to abstract collection   (BC_BAD_CAST_TO_ABSTRACT_COLLECTION)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: REL</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: 4</p>
<p class="desc">From: FindBugs Rules 3.0.0</p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="subdesc">This code casts a Collection to an abstract collection (such as <code>List</code>, <code>Set</code>, or <code>Map</code>). Ensure that you are guaranteed that the object is of the type you are casting to. If all you need is to be able to iterate through a collection, you don't need to cast it to a Set or List. </p>
<p class="subdesc">This rule impacts reliability, since an exception may be thrown if the type cannot be cast.</p>
<h4 id="BX_UNBOXED_AND_COERCED_FOR_TERNARY_OPERATOR">Bx: Primitive value is unboxed and coerced for ternary operator  (BX_UNBOXED_AND_COERCED_FOR_TERNARY_OPERATOR)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: COR</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: 3</p>
<p class="desc">From: FindBugs Rules 3.0.0</p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="subdesc">A wrapped primitive value is unboxed and converted to another primitive type as part of the evaluation of a conditional ternary operator (the <code> b ? e1 : e2</code> operator). The semantics of Java mandate that if <code>e1</code> and <code>e2</code> are wrapped numeric values, the values are unboxed and converted/coerced to their common type (e.g, if <code>e1</code> is of type <code>Integer</code> and <code>e2</code> is of type <code>Float</code>, then <code>e1</code> is unboxed, converted to a floating point value, and boxed. See JLS Section 15.25. </p>
<p class="subdesc">This rule impacts correctness, since the result is not what was intended.</p>
<h4 id="SwitchDensity">Switch Density (SwitchDensity)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: ANA CHA</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: 3</p>
<p class="desc">From: PMD Design Rules 5.1.2</p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="subdesc">A high ratio of statements to labels in a switch statement implies that the switch statement is overloaded. Consider moving the statements into new methods or creating subclasses based on the switch variable. The threshold can be configured by the user, default value is 10.</p>
<p class="subdesc">Switch Density is the number of statements over the number of cases within a switch. The higher the value, the more work each case is doing. When the Switch Density is high, you should start looking at Subclasses or State Pattern to alleviate the problem.</p>
<p class="subdesc">This rule impacts analysability, since it builds a complex control structure. It also impacts changeability, since it implies a large number of complex paths, which may cause side-effects.</p>
<h4 id="RV_RETURN_VALUE_IGNORED_BAD_PRACTICE">RV: Method ignores exceptional return value  (RV_RETURN_VALUE_IGNORED_BAD_PRACTICE)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: MAT</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: 3</p>
<p class="desc">From: FindBugs Rules 3.0.0</p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="subdesc">This method returns a value that is not checked. The return value should be checked since it can indicate an unusual or unexpected function execution. For example, the <code>File.delete()</code> method returns false if the file could not be successfully deleted (rather than throwing an Exception). If you don't check the result, you won't notice if the method invocation signals unexpected behavior by returning an atypical return value. </p>
<p class="subdesc">This rule impacts maturity, since it implies better control on the program execution.</p>
<h4 id="SE_NONSTATIC_SERIALVERSIONID">Se: serialVersionUID isn't static  (SE_NONSTATIC_SERIALVERSIONID)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: COR REL</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: 3</p>
<p class="desc">From: FindBugs Rules 3.0.0</p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="subdesc">This class defines a <code>serialVersionUID</code> field that is not static. The field should be made static if it is intended to specify the version UID for purposes of serialization.</p>
<p class="subdesc">This rule impact correctness, since ID problems may arise when serialising and deserialising objects. It also impacts reliability, since an exception may be thrown at runtime when deserialising the object.</p>
<h4 id="AbstractClassWithoutAbstractMethod">Abstract Class Without Abstract Method (AbstractClassWithoutAbstractMethod)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: ANA</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: 3</p>
<p class="desc">From: PMD Design Rules 5.1.2</p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="subdesc">The abstract class does not contain any abstract methods. An abstract class suggests an incomplete implementation, which is to be completed by subclasses implementing the abstract methods. If the class is intended to be used as a base class only (not to be instantiated directly) a protected constructor can be provided to prevent direct instantiation.</p>
<p class="subdesc">This rule impacts analysability, since the class is pointless regarding the abstract intent and the maintain will wonder why this class is abstract.</p>
